# Project Description
The objective of this project is to research methods to create voronoi or voronoi-like surfaces on an object in blender.
The voronoi surfaces must be created on an existing solid model and the voronoi surfaces must be able to be limited or contained by geometry so only a section of the model has the voronoi surface and these surface then merges with the original non-voronio surface. 
One of the outputs will be a set of instructions or steps to apply
